2021 has been an interesting year in a number of ways. Lots has happened, some good, some bad. But with a long list of things I wanted to make a recap of the year to take a lookback at what made the year so great & what could change or be done differently in 2022.

## :family: People

Life after the pandemic, for the most part, for myself has remained mostly the same. Lots of people spend their free time in a variety of ways. Me? I spend my free time spent online on [Discord](https://discord.com) with many of my closest friends playing games & having fun. It's my escape from a world of work & responsibilities.

Another year gone has gone by that I can't even imagine what it would be like without any of my amazing friends. Just to name a few:

-   [@Tactical_Sam](https://twitter.com/Tactical_Sam)
-   [@Nether_Dweller](https://twitter.com/Nether_Dweller)

I think the easiest way to show this is to show some fun clips from us playing the game we find ourselves playing almost every night, [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/):

## :iphone: Things

---

Like most years, there's a lot of "things" that people purchase or finally take the leap on & this year has been no exception, probably more so for me this year as I had finally finished my bachelor's degree & was able to start working full time & thus finally have an income to actually start buying things that I wanted. By the end of the year there are 2 key "big" purchases I've made & mean a lot to me:

### :car: Tesla

Yes, I did what most tech heads have done & bought a Tesla. But this has been a dream of mine for 5 years now. 5 YEARS! 5 years of saving, staring & dreaming about one day purchasing one. Well, in July 2021 I finally accepted a delivery of my Tesla Model 3 SR+ & words cannot describe how happy I am with the car. I felt like a kid at Christmas when I accepted delivery of it.

Fun fact: I bought it as an "ex-demo" car when it's actually an "ex-press" car features on some media outlets like [What Car?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHw3bfydrLM). Yes, that is MY car :exploding_head:!

### :computer: Macbook Pro

Like my Tesla above, it has been years of waiting for this. Similar to most other developers towards the end of the year, I purchased a new Macbook Pro with Apple's new M1 Pro processor. I settled on a 14" model in silver (Look 10x better in my opinion) with a maxed out M1 Pro processor. I need a fair bit of power, but not M1 Max power.

The main reasons for the upgrade were:

-   M1 was still too new & I wanted to see the power Apple Silicon had when really fleshed out
-   My current 2016 Macbook Pro:
    -   Performance began to degrade overall
    -   Battery life was terrible (Even after a battery replacement)
    -   The butterfly keyboard meant keys often didn't work & had to get my device serviced every few months (Some reason they never installed that "fix" for it)
    -   The touchbar is a battery draining & crashing waste of microchips that should have never been built
