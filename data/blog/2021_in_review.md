2021 has been an interesting year in a number of ways. Lots has happened, some good, some bad. But with a long list of things I wanted to make a recap of the year to take a lookback at what made the year so great & what could change or be done differently in 2022.

## :family: People

Life after the pandemic, for the most part, for myself has remained mostly the same. Lots of people spend their free time in a variety of ways. Me? I spend my free time spent online on [Discord](https://discord.com) with many of my closest friends playing games & having fun. It's my escape from a world of work & responsibilities.

Another year gone has gone by that I can't even imagine what it would be like without any of my amazing friends. Just to name a few:

-   [@katiejjk](https://twitter.com/katiejjk)
-   [@DanBennett](https://twitter.com/DanBennett)
-   [@Tactical_Sam](https://twitter.com/Tactical_Sam)
-   [@Nether_Dweller](https://twitter.com/Nether_Dweller)

I think the easiest way to show this is to show some fun clips from us playing the game we find ourselves playing almost every night, [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/):
