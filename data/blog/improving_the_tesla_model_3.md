I originally purchased my Tesla Model 3 back in July of 2021 as an [ex-press car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHw3bfydrLM&t=4s) & since the day I've had I have loved it.

It's done almost anything & everything I've needed. With "almost" being the key word there.

Now before you assume the "Oh here we go, another person complaining about stuff with Tesla that is actually nothing" or "Oh boy! More stuff I can use to show Tesla's are terrible", it's not. To make it clear from the beginning, I have only had 3 real issue's with my car in the roughly 9 months since I purchased it:

1.  **First Appointment:**

    The first 2 issues occurred shortly after delivery where I noticed that the headlights were not aligned correctly (Could have been a previous owner / driver) & that there was a slight wind noise coming from the front passengers side of the car.

    Opened the Tesla mobile app, booked an appointment to take the car in, a few hours later I collected the car, & the wind noise was gone & headlights re-calibrated. Quick & simple.

2.  **Second Appointment:**

    The second issue was to do with one of the camera's around the car. In December 2021 the left pillar camera refused to load in the camera viewer & AutoPilot warned me that it could not use the camera. I assumed the camera was broken or a connector had come loose or something.

    Once again, opened the Tesla mobile app, booked another appointment to take the car in, and once again a few hours later I collected the car & Tesla had replaced the camera for free to fix the issue.

That's it. Those are all the issues I have had with the car in the ~9 months I have had it.
Now we've covered the car, let's talk improvements.

### :hammer: Hardware

---

For the most part the car comes with everything you need, but there's a few things that would be nice to haves to be able to either get added to all cars or as an add-on.

-   **💪 Powered Frunk**:

    Seen this around a lot for other people who mod their cars to add it on & would be a neat addition, either as an optional extra or as standard, as it might actually make be use the frunk more.

-   **👓 Heads Up Display**:

    Most high ends cars of similar value come with a simple HUD projector in front of the steering wheel to make it easier to see stuff about your car while you drive. This would be especially helpful considering how much is already offloaded to the center screen.

-   **🚿 Wiper switch on the left stalk**:

    Sometimes you really don't need to reinvent the wheel. In this case why do not have a turnable switch to turn off, or adjust the speed, of the wipers. Why do I have to take my eyes off the road to navigate through a menu to adjust them?

### :nerd_face: Software

---

There's a lot of bits to do with software that could just do with adding or improving so I'm just going to fire through them all:

-   [🍎 Apple CarPlay](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/carplay/)

-   💂‍♂️ Sentry-mode

    -   ⏰ Active hours

        Only turn on sentry mode during certain times. For example at night at home

    -   📹 Cabin camera viewer

    -   ⬇️ Download clips from the mobile app

-   👪 Passenger seat profiles

-   🎟️ [Plex](http://plex.tv/) theatre app

-   📺 [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/) theatre app

    👉 [Thanks for this one Disney](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1473793631354040322?s=20&t=aXJlrsikapTnoMcTuwxYNQ)

-   [🍎 Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/)

-   ⬇️ App Store

-   🌐 Browser Fullscreen button

-   🔀 Transfer FSD to new vehicle

Also throwing this in at the end: The V11 update is terrible & I wish I could revert to the old UI when trying to perform an action didn't take an extract 2-3 taps which, especially while driving, is a pain & could be dangerous.

### :bug: Bugs

---

So far there hasn't been any big noticeable bugs, but there are a few that are annoying at times & really could do with fixing.

-   **🚿 Wiper max speed after washing**:

    Like most people, I leave my wipers on automatic when possible. That way I don't have to turn them on myself if it starts to rain.
    However, as of late I have noticed an issue where the wipers set themselves to max speed immediately after I use my wiper fluid.

    I assume this is a bug with some water getting near / completely covering one of the rain sensors so it assumes it's raining very hard when it's not. But if that's the case, why does not rely on multiple sensors to cancel our a false positive?

-   **💡 Auto highbeams**:

    Where I leave we have a very long country & straight country road. At night when it's pitch black & you cannot see anything so it obviously makes sense to turn your high beams on so you can see more. But even though it is pitch black & I cannot see anything and neither can the car or its camera's, it for some reason refuses to turn high beams on automatically.

-   **🎧 Spotify refuses to play some songs**:

    I am not the only one with this issue but sometimes a new song will come on, a few seconds of waiting while the car tries to play the song, fails for whatever reason & either will just sit there & do nothing or skip to the next song.

    At least use that very fancy notification prompt to inform the user that it couldn't play the song & maybe even explain why?

And that's it, for now at least.

I do love my car, but nothing is perfect & this is just a few ways I really wish my car would get better, most of which can be done via over-the-air software updates thankfully.
